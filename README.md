# Loan_Qualifier

As an application developer for a fintech lending startup. The lending software that Iâ€™ve built has had great successes for the company I work for and so I was assigned the task of creating additional useful features.

Specifically, the task at hand was to see if the software can prompt the user to save the qualifying loans as a new CSV file.

This project was a great opportunity to showcase my software engineering skills.

This is a reference of code containing an essential parameter during the qualifing process pertaining to credit scoring. 

Factors to determin loan qualification in this project are credit score, debt to income, loan to value and the max loan size the banks are willing to lend to.
